# Message Passing Strategies and Usage
## 1. REST
REST is an HTTP-based interface for passing messages. It allows modelling a hierarchical representation of
the application state and allows a lot of flexibility.
This will be used for communicating with the Frontend application.
The location consumer will subscribe to the Kafka location topic (see below) and call the REST location-api in order to feed the data to the database.
The location-api can be replaced by a direct database connection from the location consumer as a future enhancement.

## 2. gRPC
gRPC is a highly efficient means to transport data adhering to a predefined structure. This is particularly 
useful for large volume data, e.g. that from the mobile devices in the UdaConnect app.
This will hence be used for the mobile devices to send the location data.

## 3. Kafka
Kafka is a message broker and allows queuing high volume data asynchronously from a large number of producers and consumers of this data.
Kafka is used to ingest the location data and to feed it to the location data consumer.
